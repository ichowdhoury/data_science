### Project Problem and Hypothesis

What's the project about? What problem are you solving?
Ans: My project is about predicting daily average hi/low temperature for 2017. Is 2017 going to be a hotter year. 

Where does this seem to reside as a machine learning problem? Are you predicting some continuous number, or predicting a binary value?
Ans: Using the past observed temp for last five years, predicting the future temperature seems to be a machine learning problem. As far as my understanding it will be a continuous number. 

What kind of impact do you think it could have?
Ans: It could help determine a futuristic plan for the coming year. 

What do you think will have the most impact in predicting the value you are interested in solving for?
Ans: It can help proving the global warming and to determine the trends of temperature rise year to year. 


Description of data set available, at the field level (see table)
Ans: I will be collecting the past temp from wunderground.com. They provide an open source API for these data. I will also collect data from weather.com’s API for avg hi/low temp for each day.

If from an API, include a sample return (this is usually included in API documentation!) (if doing this in markdown, use the javacription code tag)

What experience do you already have around this area?
Ans: I have been working as a Test Engineer for weather.com more then few years. During this time I was responsible to test integrity of data from backend to frontend in numerous applications. 

Does it relate or help inform the project in any way?
Ans: Even though, I am not an weather expert. I believe it does help me to understand the terms and relations to some extent. 

What other research efforts exist?
Ans: As it seems that lots of weather enthusiast has worked to predict the forecast of weather and overall futuristic  but there is not a lot of day by day predictions. There are lots of article on temperature rise and global warming. Wunderground.com has vest data on historical weather data but limited on forecast. 
There is one work that could be found on edwardtufte.com. Where Edward Tufte has worked with 2003 temperature for New York city. My goal is to see if I could create a graph like visualization for predicted temperature. 


### Project Concerns

Ans - I am still not very confident about finishing this project as I feel I have yet master the Regression models and different parts of statistics. The biggest challenge I am facing is, where do I begin? Which columns do I need to grab? Etc. 


### Outcomes

What do you expect the output to look like?
Ans: I want to create an nice graph with hover ability to display the daily temperature for 2017. 

What does your target audience expect the output to look like?
Ans: I would guess audience would like a simple readability. 

What gain do you expect from your most important feature on its own?
Ans: This could be an addition to weather.com for users to plan for rest of the year. 

How complicated does your model have to be?
Ans: I think it is quite complicated. 

How successful does your project have to be in order to be considered a "success"?
And: The predicted temp should have low threshold. If the predicted temp falls +-2 for both hi and low then it can be considered successful. 	

What will you do if the project is a bust (this happens! but it shouldn't here)?
And: I don’t know.
